# Warehouse app - frontend

This is a warehouse fullstack app, where the focus is on handling the data (not that much effort on looks).
It is my first full stack app exercise. The backend is using APIs provided by Reaktor on backend for items and combining and caching the data for faster requests.
Im still working on the project to implement some more function, for example: search or filter

The frontend of warehouse app is made with React and Material-UI

Checkout the frontend source code: https://github.com/Thao-Nguyen-Ojala/warehouse-app-backend
